# NVIDIA Brev · Setup and usage

## Overview

NVIDIA Brev simplifies AI development by aggregating multiple cloud providers to deliver on-demand NVIDIA GPUs and preconfigured environments. You get instant GPU access, VM images with Python, CUDA, Docker, and Jupyter, plus “Launchables” for one-click, customizable stacks. CLI and IDE integrations include Brev CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, and tmux.

    ## Pricing and packaging

Self-service, pay-as-you-go access with transparent hourly rates per GPU instance type, aggregated from partners. Launchables are one-click deployments pairing predefined compute with preconfigured software.

## Quick start

1. Create an account.
2. Create an organization.
3. Redeem a coupon if you have one.
4. Invite collaborators.
5. Start with a Launchable or create an instance from scratch.
6. Follow the walkthrough or demo to run your first workload.

## Redeem credits (individual org)

1. Go to brev.nvidia.com and create an account.
2. Create a new Brev organization. In the console, select Create a new organization, then name it.
3. Open the Billing tab in the top navigation of the Brev console.
4. Click Redeem Code, enter your coupon in lowercase, and select Redeem.

## Best practices for credits

* Instances are pay by the hour while running. Stop instances when not in use to conserve credits.
* A stopped instance incurs only a small daily charge. See pricing in the Brev web interface.
* When selecting compute, choose options that support stopping and restarting. Some providers only allow delete, not stop. Brev shows a warning for those. Pick restartable options for the best experience and credit efficiency.

## Instances and Launchables

* **Instances:** on-demand NVIDIA GPUs from partner clouds, provisioned quickly. Choose the GPU type and image for your workload.
* **Launchables:** one-click, predefined software plus compute combinations to standardize team environments and speed onboarding.

## CLI and editor integrations

Use the Brev CLI and connect your preferred editor: Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, or tmux.
